#### Q: Can I submit my non-archival accepted paper in other venues?
__A:__ Yes.

#### Q: If accepted, can a paper be published in the proceedings, even if it the student cannot take part at the workshop?
__A:__ The ACL organizing team will attempt to provide travel grants to authors of all accepted papers. However, if things still don't work out, we can discuss remote presentation options should your paper be accepted.
 
#### Q: If the student is graduating before the mentoring/submission deadline, can they still submit to SRW?
__A:__ If the bulk of the work was done when the author was a student, it is acceptable to submit to SRW.
 
#### Q: What is the format for a thesis proposal?
__A:__ Thesis proposals are to be submitted in the same ACL Overleaf Long Paper template. The maximum page limit for the proposal should be 8 pages (plus unlimited pages for references and appendices). We include Thesis Proposals as a separate track in the submission website since these might involve works overlapping many different areas of NLP. Please refer to the following examples from past years - [1](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-srw.8.pdf) and [2](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-srw.4.pdf).
