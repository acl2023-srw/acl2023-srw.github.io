#### Q: Can I submit my non-archival accepted paper in other venues?
__A:__ Yes.

#### Q: If accepted, can a paper be published in the proceedings, even if it the student cannot take part at the workshop?
__A:__ The ACL organizing team will attempt to provide travel grants to authors of all accepted papers. However, if things still don't work out, we can discuss remote presentation options should your paper be accepted.
 
#### Q: If the student is graduating before the mentoring/submission deadline, can they still submit to SRW?
__A:__ If the bulk of the work was done when the author was a student, it is acceptable to submit to SRW.
